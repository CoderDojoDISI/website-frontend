### Sample Data Import


It's possible run the 'import-samples.js' script to load sample data in MongoDB
through http calls to the Server's APIs.

*NB: Docker's containers must be up and running.*

**Usage**

From the project's root folder:

```
  npm run sample-data
```

or

```
gulp sample-data
```
